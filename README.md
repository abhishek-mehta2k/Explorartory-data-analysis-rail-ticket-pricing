# Explorartory-data-analysis-rail-ticket-pricing
In this project, we are trying to analyse Spain Rail Ticket Data. This selected dataset covers data about the different trips by different trains with differnt duration and prices.  Personally I find `Pricing` quite interesting because it helps to analyze about pattern of the change in price over time period and many factors.
